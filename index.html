		<h2>WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE?</h2>
		<p>
			There is little understanding as to what exactly happens with their data and an increasing fear as to who can sell and own it. This is causing a feeling of suspicion and worry for most people; their anxieties are fuelled by a lack of simple, well-explained facts upon which they can base their decisions and make educated choices about how to share their data.

		</p>
		<div class="more">
			<p>
				At the same time, government agencies and industry are moving towards data-driven services that deliver value for both the recipient and service provider. In order for the benefits to be realised on both sides, both supplier and consumer in this data exchange must be informed, cognisant and willing.
			</p>
			<p>
				A successful democratic society depends on a knowledgeable populace who can make informed decisions. This helps government and industry alike, and we see this focus on empowering people through knowledge as a missing piece in putting the UK at the forefront of the worldwide digital renaissance. Big Data is here to stay, and both government and private organisations can reap huge benefits from analysing it. However, to truly achieve this, citizens must have greater awareness and a larger say in how their personal data is used.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will work with the Office for National Statistics a research partner to identify representative persona types, and recruit individuals to the five year programme. Their behaviour and attitudes will be measured formally through in-person interviews as well as informally through self-capturing data on devices we provide them.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will supplement the ongoing personalised data-capture and in-person interviews with single-topic focused events and an annual conference. As we progress through the programme, we will run modding sessions to make/improve tools and investigate data thatâ€™s being used or generated by the persona representatives.
